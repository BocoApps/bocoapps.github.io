        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Effective Date: September 26, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Boco Apps (“we,” “us,” or “our”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use our mobile application <strong>My Database</strong> (the “App”). Since we operate from Sweden, this policy complies with the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> and other applicable data protection laws.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Collected by Us</strong><br>
              We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process any personal data. The App does not require an account, track your activity, or save your information.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Collected by Third Parties (Google AdMob)</strong><br>
              The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. Google may collect certain information automatically, such as:
              <ul>
                <li>Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID, IP address).</li>
                <li>Device type, operating system, and app usage data.</li>
                <li>Location data (if enabled on your device).</li>
                <li>Other data for ad personalization and analytics.</li>
              </ul>
              This data is collected and processed by Google, not by us. For details, please see the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543">AdMob policies</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Within the EU/EEA</strong>: Google AdMob processes personal data for personalized ads based on <strong>user consent</strong>. You may be asked to grant or deny consent before such ads are shown. Non-personalized ads may rely on <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (e.g., for basic ad serving).</li>
            <li><strong>Outside the EU/EEA</strong>: Data may be processed based on <strong>legitimate interests</strong> or other applicable bases under local laws.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. How Information Is Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not use or process any personal data ourselves.</li>
            <li>Google AdMob uses data only for advertising, analytics, and to improve their services, in line with their policies.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Your Choices and Controls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opting Out of Personalized Ads</strong><br>
              You can control how ads are shown by adjusting your device settings:
              <ul>
                <li>On Android: Go to Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization or Reset Advertising ID.</li>
                <li>On iOS: Go to Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising → Turn off Personalized Ads.</li>
              </ul>
              Additionally, use Google's <a href="https://myadcenter.google.com">My Ad Center</a> to customize ad topics, brands, and sensitive categories. More details are available in Google’s <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922">Ad personalization guide</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5. Data Retention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not retain any personal data.</li>
            <li>Google AdMob retains data according to its own policies—for example, anonymizing IP addresses after 9 months and cookie information after 18 months for advertising data. Review Google's retention details <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/retention">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>6. Sharing of Information</h3>
        <p>We do not share any user data. Data collected by Google AdMob may be shared by Google with its partners as explained in their privacy policy.</p>
        
        <h3>7. Data Security</h3>
        <p>We take reasonable technical measures to protect the App from unauthorized access or misuse. However, since all ad-related data is handled by Google, security for that data is governed by Google’s safeguards.</p>
        
        <h3>8. Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This App is <strong>not designed for children under 13</strong> (or 16 in some jurisdictions).</li>
            <li>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</li>
            <li>If you believe a child has interacted with ads in a way that involves data collection, please contact us, and we will work with Google to address the issue.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>9. Your Rights Under GDPR</h3>
        <p>As an EU/EEA user, you may have the following rights regarding any personal data processed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right to access, correct, or delete personal data.</li>
            <li>Right to restrict or object to processing.</li>
            <li>Right to data portability.</li>
            <li>Right to withdraw consent at any time (e.g., for personalized ads).</li>
            <li>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g., the <strong>Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection, IMY</strong>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since we do not process personal data ourselves, these rights generally apply to data collected by Google AdMob. You can contact Google directly or reach out to us for assistance.</p>
        
        <h3>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be posted in the App or otherwise communicated. Your continued use of the App means you accept the updated policy.</p>
