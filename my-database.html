        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My Database is a versatile application for smartphones designed to manage customizable SQLite databases with integrated image support. It allows users to create, edit, and organize multiple databases, tables, and records (posts) containing text fields and attached images.</p>
        <p>Key features include database encryption with passwords, importing/exporting data in ZIP (database + images), pure SQLite DB, or CSV formats, keyword search with advanced filters (contains, equals, greater/less than, between) and sorting, image handling (uploading from gallery/camera with EXIF rotation, compression, thumbnails, full-screen viewing with zoom and swipe navigation), and customizable settings like light/dark themes, image quality (high/low compression), thumbnail scaling (50%‚Äì300%), and option to show all posts on table open.</p>
        <p>The app supports pagination for efficient handling of large datasets, isolated background processing for imports/exports with progress indicators, column management (add, rename, delete, reorder), and exporting search results as CSV. Ideal for personal data management, inventory tracking, or visual note-taking, the app ensures secure, offline storage with robust error handling and permissions management.</p>

        <h2>Tutorial</h2>
        <p>This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to using all features of <strong>My Database</strong> on your smartphone. The app opens on the Databases screen by default (or loads the default database/table if configured). Navigation is intuitive, using buttons, long-press gestures for options, and dialogs for inputs.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The app requests permissions for storage, photos, and camera as needed‚Äîgrant them for full functionality. If denied, enable them in your phone's settings. For Android 11+, enable "All files access" in the app's settings for imports/exports. Heavy tasks like exports/imports run in background isolates to display progress and prevent UI freezes.</p>
        
        <h3>Getting Started and Settings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Launch the App:</strong> On first run, the app imports sample data from embedded ZIP assets (Animals.zip and people_100000.zip) into the documents directory. It creates databases with tables and adds an 'image_paths' column if missing. The Databases list screen appears.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Settings:</strong> Tap the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top-right of the Databases screen.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>App Version:</strong> Displays the current version and build number (via package_info_plus).</li>
                    <li><strong>Theme:</strong> Select "Dark Mode" via toggle. Changes apply instantly and are saved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Image Quality:</strong> Toggle "High Image Quality" on/off. High quality uses no compression (larger files); low (85%) compresses images for efficiency during uploads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thumbnail Scale:</strong> Adjust the slider (50%‚Äì300%) to change thumbnail sizes in lists and viewers. Higher scales enlarge previews but may slow loading for large datasets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show All Posts on Open:</strong> Toggle to load all posts immediately when opening a table (vs. lazy loading with pagination).</li>
                </ul>
            Tap "Close" to save and exit. Settings persist across sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Home Navigation:</strong> From any screen, tap the home icon (üè†) in the app bar to return to the Databases list.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Managing Databases</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ZIP Import:</strong> Select a .zip file; it extracts the .db and images to the app's documents directory, with a progress dialog.</li>
                    <li><strong>SQLite Import:</strong> Select a .db/.sqlite/.sqlite3 file; copies it and adds 'image_paths' if missing.</li>
                    <li><strong>CSV Import:</strong> Select a .csv file; creates a new database/table with columns from headers (sanitized names), imports rows in batches with a progress dialog.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Imports process in a background isolate (showing % progress) and refresh the list.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Database Options (Long-Press a Database Name)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Set as Default:</strong> Configures it (and its default table) to open automatically on app launch.</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> Choose "Save to Device" (select folder) or "Share" (via share_plus). Exports as ZIP (database + all referenced images, collected via batch queries), with a progress dialog in an isolate. For encrypted DBs, prompts for password.</li>
            <li><strong>Rename:</strong> Edit the name in the text field and tap "Rename" (updates file and preferences).</li>
            <li><strong>Add Password:</strong> Enter a new password to encrypt (uses sqlcipher_export in a temp DB).</li>
            <li><strong>Remove Password:</strong> Enter the current password to decrypt (similar process).</li>
            <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Confirm to permanently delete the .db file (and unreferenced images).</li>
            <li><strong>Reorder:</strong> Use up/down arrows to move in the list (saves order).</li>
            <li>Tap "Cancel" to exit options.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Managing Tables (Inside a Database)</h3>
        <p>From the Databases screen, tap a database to view its tables list (queried via sqlite_master, excluding system tables).</p>
        <h4>Creating a Table</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Tap the floating "+" button.</li>
            <li>Enter a table name (e.g., "Entries", sanitized to letters/numbers/underscores) and optional columns (comma-separated, e.g., "title,description"). The 'image_paths' (TEXT) column is auto-added for image support.</li>
            <li>Tap "Create".</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Table Options (Long-Press a Table Name)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Set as Default:</strong> Pairs with the default database for auto-open on launch.</li>
            <li><strong>Rename:</strong> Edit the name (sanitized) and tap "Rename".</li>

        <ul>
            <li>In card or detailed view: Tap "+Gallery" or "+Camera" (appends to existing image_paths JSON).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Viewing Images</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Tap a thumbnail for full-screen viewer (PageView with InteractiveViewer for zoom up to 32x, swipe navigation; disables scroll when zoomed). Tap to exit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Detailed Post View (Single Post Screen)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Shows all fields and larger thumbnails. Long-press for edit/delete. Add images or edit/delete as above. Updates refresh the list.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Searching and Filtering Posts</h3>
        <h4>Simple Search</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Enter keywords in the search bar (e.g., "apple pie").</li>
            <li>Tap search icon or enter: Filters across text columns (LIKE %term% or FTS if table has fts_table). Results paginate.</li>
            <li>Clear bar (X) to reset.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Showing All Posts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Tap "All" button to display everything (ignores search).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Advanced Search (Tune Icon)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sort:</strong> Choose column and ASC/DESC (applies ORDER BY).</li>
            <li><strong>Filters:</strong> Per column, select operator (None, Contains, Equals, >, <, Between) and values (casts to REAL for numbers). Combines with AND (and with simple search if active).</li>
            <li>Tap "Apply" to filter (resets pagination). "Reset" clears dialog.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Exporting Search Results</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Tap download icon (‚Üì) in app bar.</li>
            <li>Select folder to save as CSV (all columns except image_paths, full results not just page).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Count Display</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Shows "Found X entries" (or "Total" if no search) below bar (queried separately, with loading indicator).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Additional Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> Auto-loads on scroll end; efficient for large sets (e.g., 100k rows).</li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Prompts for passwords on open/export; snackbars for errors (e.g., wrong password, invalid CSV). Ignores JSON parse errors in image_paths.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Uses batches (1000 rows) for exports; isolates for ZIP/CSV processing. High quality increases sizes; thumbnails always JPEG.</li>
            <li><strong>Back Navigation:</strong> Use phone's back button or home icon.</li>
            <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If imports/exports fail, check permissions/file paths. Restart app if stuck. For encrypted DBs, always enter password when prompted.</li>
        </ul>
